# M09 — Advanced sync/diagnostics

Gate: **BLOCKED — not passed**. No milestone acceptance has advanced beyond the unresolved M0 build/GUI environment gate. Independent source/service work below is partial; pending implementation is not attributed solely to external approvals.

Implemented/prepared: Latest-version manifest reconciliation simulation; payload hashes; basic DB/snapshot/stock/audit diagnostics.

Files: packages/sync/worker.ts; packages/db/store.ts.

Actual current service regression: `npm test` — 56/56 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped. This shared count is not a claim of Advanced sync/diagnostics GUI or Windows verification. Exact test cases/log: qa/logs/v4-offline-tests.tap. `npm run lint` parses source only. Build, strict typecheck and desktop verification stop with recorded dependency/build blockers.

Pending: Real Drive/Sheets, PDF/backup integrity/repair and conflicts UI, read-only viewer choice, comprehensive health center.

Screenshots/PDF visual review: BLOCKED; none captured or inspected. No GUI click/demo claimed. Migration/recovery/security implications are documented in docs/DATA_MODEL.md, MIGRATION_V3_TO_V4.md, SECURITY_MODEL.md and BACKUP_AND_RECOVERY.md.

Performance: 10k synthetic service benchmark in qa/logs/performance.json; full register 136.3 ms after fix, issue p95 1.56 ms. Not a Windows/GUI benchmark; memory 491.3 MiB, further optimization/targets pending.

Demo commands: `npm test`; `node scripts/performance.ts 10000`. For desktop, install dependencies in a suitable environment, run typecheck/build and actual Electron E2E, then inspect every screenshot/PDF. No publishing command is authorized.

Next: resolve execution/dependency blockers and unfinished scope for this gate, fix/retest, record genuine acceptance evidence, then advance sequentially. Owner/CA approvals remain listed in docs/OPEN_DECISIONS.md.
